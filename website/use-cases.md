# Use Cases

These are the use cases that this working group is writing specifications to address.


## Use Case 1: Automated Discovery of Public Data and Capabilities <a id="automated-dicsovery" href="#automated-dicsovery" class="permalink">ðŸ”—</a>

As the energy grid evolves and energy transition progresses, many companies, service providers, organizations, governments, and other external entities around the world have an increasing need to automate interactions with utilities and other central entities (e.g. ISOs, DSOs, TSOs, energy markets, etc.).

However, because the energy grid is highly fragmented across regions and different functional levels, external entities have difficulty finding and figuring out what utilities and other central entities are publishing technical public data (e.g. carbon emissions, tariffs details, territory coverage maps, etc.) and what interoperability capabilities they have available. The current status quo is highly manual, where external entities must individually check each utility or other central entity's own non-standardized publication formats to discover what utilities have what information and interoperable functionality.

This working group aims to address this currently manual process by specifying for how utilities and other central entities can publish structured public data about themselves and what kinds of externally available connectivity capabilities they offer, thus allowing for automation of a previously manual process.

#### Needs:

* **Automated Discovery:**
Because the energy grid is highly fragmented and variable, the specifications must allow external entities to automatically discover new utilities and other central entities as they begin publishing or modifying their public metadata and capabilities.

* **Coverage Details:**
External entities that need to interact with utilities and other central entities need to be able to differentiate the territory for which the discovered utility operates. This specification must allow external entities to automatically determine what coverage a utility or other central entity has.

* **Extensible Capability Disclosure Framework:**
As the energy grid evolves, utilities and other central entities have begun to offer many different use cases, protocols, and other connectivity means (i.e. "capabilities") for external entities to iteract with them. This specification must allow utilities and other central entities a means by which they can publish the wide array of capabilities they offer using a flexible, extensible framework for capability publishing.
